Insurance Claim Prediction - Claims Analysis        

This project aims to anticipate whether the insurance will be claimed or not based on various attributes such as age, bmi, gender, smoker/non-smoker, etc.
I have understood the dataset and performed EDA and pre-processing and eventually built a Decision Tree Classification model to predict whether the insurance will be claimed or not.

I solved the problem statement by following these steps:

1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Predictive Modeling
5. Project Outcomes & Conclusion
